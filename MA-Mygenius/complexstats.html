        <h1 style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;color: darkolivegreen;"> 2 complex stats within the MLB</h1>
        <p class="p" style="font: bold;">Baseball is a sport in which complex stats are the norm to determining a players skill, as one can uncover a new stat each week! OPS and WRC+ are two of the most complex yet crucial stats in the sport.</p>
    </div>
<h2>OPS</h2>
<p class="p">OPS (On-base + Slugging): This is a more advanced stat that combines two other stats, on base percentage and slugging percentage. On base percentage, similar to batting avergage, is the percentage of one reaching base (but in any form) converted into a decimal. Slugging percentage is a stat used to measure the type of hits one is getting.</p>
<p class="p">It is calculated by this formula (Singles + Doublesx2 + Triplesx3 + Home Runsx4)/times batted. OPS adds these together to determine how one effectivley reaches base but effectivley hits for power</p>

<h2>WRC+</h2>
<P class="p" style="font-size: 16;">WRC+(Weighted Runs Created +): This stat factors in almost all offensive stats such as batting average, home runs, and total hits.</P>
<p class="p" style="font-size: 16;"> Other advanced stats that incorperate these ones are are added once and once they all get divded, WRC+ is created. This allows once to see the production of their favorite player, as with a high WRC+, you can see they are having a positive contribution at the plate!</p>
